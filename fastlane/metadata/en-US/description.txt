LASA Schedules is the bell schedule, reimagined for iPhone. With just a glance, see your next class and how many minutes are left until it begins. Your entire day is just one tap away.

LASA Schedules tracks your time intelligently by not only providing one place to view all of the LASA bell schedules, but by syncing them to your day at school. Enable badge notifications to see a live countdown of minutes until your next class on the Schedules icon. Push notifications remind you that Wednesday is an advisory day, tell you whether Friday is an A or B day, and inform you of which LASA events are coming up soon.
